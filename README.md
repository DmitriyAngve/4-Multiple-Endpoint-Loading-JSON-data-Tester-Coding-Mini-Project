# 4-Multiple-Endpoint-Loading-JSON-data-Tester-Coding-Mini-Project

This is a practice project where I connect to some endpoints and dynamically loading the data onto the page. These endpoints are also going to have different data structures They're going to have dufferent properties and values. 
So the objective is to part in order to be able to troubleshoot the various JSON endpoints and how to and how to handle those. And output the content on the page and make use of the content.
After click the button, it's changing the endpoints. Buttons connecting to endpoints and then dynamically adjusting and outputting the content on the page.

Unpretentious style included!
